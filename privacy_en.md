# Iglu Privacy Policy

Welcome to Iglu! This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your personal data and ensure your privacy while using our smart personal journal app. Our commitment is to protect your information and provide full transparency about how it is managed.

## Introduction

Iglu is a personal journal app designed to help you organize your ideas, memories, and thoughts in a secure, private, easy, and intelligent way. This policy explains how we ensure your data remains exclusively under your control.

## Data Collection and Storage

Iglu does not store or process user data on its own servers. All information created and managed within the app is stored on the user's device and automatically synchronized with iCloud. This synchronization serves as a security measure to protect data against loss or device damage, ensuring the integrity and recovery of the data.

Iglu does not request or collect personal information, such as name, email, or any other data that can identify the user, for its own servers. However, the app allows users to attach the location where each entry was written, as well as photos and videos to entries.

Location data, photos, and videos are linked only to the user's entries and remain stored exclusively on the device and iCloud, without any collection, processing, or access by us. Additionally, users have full freedom to decide whether the Iglu app will have access to contextual attachment data, such as location, photos, or videos, and can manage these permissions at any time.

Regardless of the permissions granted to the app, the Iglu company will never have access to any user data, even with explicit authorization.

Storage in iCloud complies with Apple's privacy policy. Iglu has no access, visibility, or control over data stored in iCloud, respecting the user's total privacy.

## Data Usage

Data entered in Iglu is used exclusively to provide a personalized and intuitive user experience, with the following purposes:

Smart recommendations: The app suggests related entries based on the input content, helping users recall and connect thoughts, memories, and ideas. Smart search: Organizes and presents existing entries efficiently, according to the user's search commands. Contextual attachments: Allows users to link date, time, location, photos, and videos to entries, facilitating the organization and contextualization of their memories and records. All data processing occurs locally on the user's device. Data stored in iCloud, such as backups or for synchronization, follows Apple's privacy and security rules. At no time does Iglu transfer, process, or use user data outside the local device environment or iCloud, ensuring complete privacy.

## Data Sharing

At Iglu, your privacy is our priority. We do not share, sell, trade, or transfer any user data to third parties, including advertisers, business partners, or any other entities.

All information entered into the app, including entries, location attachments, photos, videos, and any other data, remains under your control and is stored exclusively on your device and iCloud. We do not use your data for commercial purposes, external analyses, or any activity that compromises your privacy.

Additionally, Iglu was designed to operate without the need for interaction with proprietary servers, eliminating any risk of information leakage or improper exposure. Even in cases of technical support, we will never request access to your personal data or records.

With Iglu, you are guaranteed that your information is private, secure, and used exclusively by you as part of our dedication to protecting your trust and confidentiality.

## Data Storage and Security

Iglu data is stored locally on the user's device and in iCloud. To ensure the security and privacy of your information, Iglu relies on the native encryption of your iOS device's operating system. This encryption is designed to ensure that your data remains secure even if your device is lost or accessed by unauthorized parties.

We recommend that you keep your device protected with passwords, biometrics, and regularly update your device's operating system security to prevent unauthorized access. Iglu does not store or process data on its own servers, eliminating the risk of exposure on external servers.

When using iCloud for synchronization, Apple applies encryption to ensure that your data is protected during transmission and storage, with only you having access to it.

With these security layers, Iglu provides a protected environment for your memories, ideas, and thoughts.

## User Rights

As an Iglu user, you have full control over your data, within the limitations described in this policy:

Access and management: You can edit or delete your entries while they are available for editing. After 1 day of entry creation, it becomes immutable. This measure aims to preserve memories in their original form, promoting an authentic and reliable record that enhances reflection and self-discovery. Despite this, Iglu allows you to comment on entries even after the 1-day period, enabling you to add new reflections, updates, or contexts to the original memories without altering the already recorded content. Total deletion: If desired, you can delete all your entries and personal data at any time, resetting the app to its initial state. This action deletes all information stored locally on the device and in iCloud and is irreversible. Permission control: Iglu respects your choices and does not require access to the camera, gallery, or location to function. If you choose not to grant these permissions, the app will continue to operate normally, just without the functionalities dependent on these accesses, such as attaching photos, videos, or location data to entries.

## Cookies and Tracking Technologies

Iglu does not use cookies or tracking technologies to collect user information.

## Use of Iglu by Minors

Iglu is an app suitable for all ages and can be used by users of any age group. However, its use by minors must follow applicable legal guidelines and best practices for data protection.

Iglu does not collect personal information that can directly identify the user, such as name, email, or phone number, and is designed to ensure the privacy and security of your data. Even so, it is the responsibility of parents or legal guardians to supervise minors' use of the app, especially children under 13.

Per legal requirements such as the Brazilian Child and Adolescent Statute (ECA), the General Data Protection Law (LGPD), and the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), by allowing minors to use Iglu, legal guardians should:

Ensure the app's use is appropriate for the minor's age and maturity. Monitor permissions granted to the app, such as access to the camera, gallery, and location. Evaluate the app's features to ensure they are being used safely and beneficially. Iglu, in turn, reinforces its commitment to privacy, ensuring that users' data, including minors', is stored exclusively on the user's device and iCloud, without access or processing by the company.

We recommend that parents guide children on using Iglu safely and responsibly, explaining that the app is a personal space for recording memories, reflections, and thoughts. It is also important to monitor granted permissions, reinforce device security, and encourage responsible usage habits.

## Changes to the Privacy Policy

Iglu's Privacy Policy will be reviewed and updated at least once a year to incorporate app updates, legal adjustments, or service improvements. When changes occur, users will be clearly informed via in-app notifications, ensuring full transparency.

## Compliance with Data Protection Laws

Iglu operates in full compliance with Brazil's General Data Protection Law (LGPD) and other applicable data protection laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).

Our commitment is to ensure that no personal information is accessed, collected, processed, or shared by our company, guaranteeing users total privacy and security when using the app.

The app also does not use external APIs or any third-party tools that could compromise the privacy and security of user information, ensuring total protection and control over your data.

## Non-Discrimination Guarantee

Iglu values the privacy and rights of all users. We guarantee that no user will be discriminated against for exercising their privacy rights, as described in this policy. This means:

Access to the app, its features, and the quality of the experience provided by Iglu will not be affected if you choose to exercise your rights, such as data deletion or permission restrictions. We will not restrict or limit app usage due to decisions related to privacy settings. Our commitment is to provide an equal, secure, and respectful experience for all users, regardless of their privacy-related choices.
